    "## Background\n",
    "Bombay Hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation $W = 1000 + 5X$, where $X$ represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",

    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing."
